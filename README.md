[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jaimores/Activity1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jaimores/Activity1)

The `Activity1` package has been create to validate the elements learned in the course  [`Building R Packages`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages). The `Activity1` package contains five functions designed to facilite the read and summary of the available data in the [US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars) (FARS), which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Those functions are: 

* `fars_read`  
* `make_filename`  
* `fars_read_years`  
* `fars_summarize_years`   
* `fars_map_state`  

A description of the usefulness of these functions with practical examples are included in The vignette file.
